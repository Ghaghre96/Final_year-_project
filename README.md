# Demand Forecasting and Inventory Management of Medicines in a Healthcare Centre

### Note: The code and PowerPoint presentation will not be available until my thesis is completed due to confidentiality reasons.

## Overview
This project involves the development of a Machine Learning (ML) based solution for demand forecasting and inventory management of medicines in a healthcare center. The primary objective is to accurately predict pharmaceutical demand, optimize inventory levels, and ensure the timely availability of critical medications. The dataset contains information on various features such as date, gender, age, diagnosis, and multiple medicines along with their corresponding quantities.


## Machine Learning Models
The ML models selected for this project include:

**Time Series Models:**
- ARIMA
- Holt-Winters
- Holt-Linear
- Simple Moving Average
- Exponential Smoothing

**Supervised Learning Models:**
- XG Boost
- Random Forest

## Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:

1. Develop and implement time series models to analyze and predict pharmaceutical demand over time.
2. Utilize XG Boost and Random Forest algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy.
3. Optimize inventory management to ensure the timely availability of critical medications.
4. Provide insights into medication demand patterns based on gender, age, and diagnosis.

## Project Workflow
**Data Preprocessing:**
- Handle missing values in the dataset.
- Convert categorical variables into a suitable format for ML models.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyze the distribution of medication demand.
- Explore correlations between different features.

**Feature Engineering:**
- Create additional relevant features if needed.
- Normalize or scale features as required.

**Model Training:**
- Train time series models (ARIMA, Holt-Winters, etc.) on historical data.
- Train supervised learning models (XG Boost, Random Forest) to predict medication demand.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
- Select the best-performing models for deployment.

**Deployment:**
- Deploy the chosen models in a production environment for real-time demand forecasting.

**Monitoring and Maintenance:**
- Implement monitoring systems to track model performance over time.
- Regularly update models and retrain them to adapt to changing demand patterns.

By achieving these objectives, the ML-based solution aims to enhance the efficiency of pharmaceutical demand forecasting and inventory management in the healthcare supply chain.
